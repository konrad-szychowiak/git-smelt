# Introduction

[`git-smelt`] is a library designed to facilitate usage of different git hosts' APIs.

The solution is based on [_smelters_] â€“ classes, that provide methods to access
specific endpoints on the hosts' side. For example you can use `getUser` on any [_smelter_][_smelters_]
to get user data from **any** of the supported providers.

The following will work:
```js
import { gitlab, github } from 'git-smelt'

const myUsername = 'konrad-szychowiak';
const providers = [ gitlab, github ];
providers.forEeach((provider) => {
  provider
    .getUser(myUsername)
    .then(r => {
      console.log(r);
    })
    .catch(e => {
      console.error(e);
    });
});
```
